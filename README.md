This is Project 5 for the [Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

Load a full demo via github pages [here](http://andrewcockerham.github.io/UdacityFENDP5NeighborhoodMap/) or open `index.html`.

Clicking on items in the list on the left will open a dropdown with tabs for Twitter, Yelp, the place website, and Instagram.  The place marker will also show its name with a link to its website and its address.

From the command line run `gulp lint` to run JSHint or `gulp html` to run an html validator.
